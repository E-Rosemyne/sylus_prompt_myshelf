The core.json file is a critical component of the custom GPT configuration. It defines the foundational rules, automations, commands, and persona settings that guide the AI Assistant’s behavior. Attaching core.json as a knowledge file ensures the GPT operates consistently and aligns with user-defined protocols. Follow these instructions to integrate core.json into your GPT system:


---

1. Prepare the core.json file starting with the foundation we provided.

1. Structure the File:

Include all necessary configurations, such as rules, automations, commands, and persona settings.

Ensure the JSON syntax is valid. Use an online JSON validator if necessary.

2. Save the File:

Save the file as core.json in a local directory.

---

2. Upload the File:

Use the GPT’s file management interface upload core.json.


3. Validate Configuration Loading:

Test a few rules or automations defined in core.json.

Example:

If a rule automates a morning greeting, trigger it by saying "Good morning" and verify the AI’s response matches the configuration.


4. Maintain and Update core.json

1. Version Control:

Track changes to core.json using a versioning system like Git to maintain a history of updates.

Store each version with descriptive commit messages for clarity.

2. Update File:

Make changes to the local copy of core.json as needed.

Re-upload the file using the same steps to replace the existing version in the GPT system.

3. Validate After Updates:

After every update, re-test key automations and commands to ensure they work as intended.
