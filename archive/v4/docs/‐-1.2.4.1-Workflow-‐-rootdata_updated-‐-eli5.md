Alright, let‚Äôs make the **`rootdata_updated` workflow** super easy to understand. Imagine you have an important notebook (your `data.json` file), and before you make any changes to it, you want to:
1. Make a safe copy.
2. Clean up old papers you don‚Äôt need anymore.
3. Put the new stuff neatly back on the shelf.

Here‚Äôs how the robot (workflow) takes care of everything step by step:

---

### **When Does the Robot Start?**
- This robot only starts when you tell it to. You press a button, and the robot wakes up and gets to work.

---

### **What Does the Robot Do?**
The robot has a checklist it follows to keep your notebook safe and your workspace clean.

---

#### **Step 1: Grab the Notebook**
- The robot goes to the shelf (your project) and pulls down your notebook (the files).
- It makes sure to grab all the pages, not just the latest ones, so it has everything it needs.

---

#### **Step 2: Put On Its Name Tag**
- The robot says, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Lyra[bot]!‚Äù so everyone knows it‚Äôs the helper.
- It also grabs the key (a secret token) that lets it safely open and lock the shelf.

---

#### **Step 3: Make a Backup**
- Before changing anything, the robot checks if the important notebook (`data.json`) is there.
  - If it finds it, it:
    - Makes a copy.
    - Puts the copy in a safe folder called `archive/`.
    - Writes the date and time on the copy so you know when it was made.
  - If the notebook isn‚Äôt there, the robot stops and says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find the notebook!‚Äù

---

#### **Step 4: Throw Out Old Backups**
- The robot looks in the `archive/` folder for backups that are more than 30 days old.
- It throws those old backups away to keep things tidy and writes down how many it removed.

---

#### **Step 5: Clean Up the Context Folder**
- The robot goes to another folder called `context/` where extra papers (files) are stored.
- It throws away anything older than 30 days.
- If the folder doesn‚Äôt exist, the robot says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here to clean!‚Äù and skips this step.

---

#### **Step 6: Save and Put Everything Back**
- The robot takes all the changes (the new backup and cleaned folders) and:
  - Adds them to the notebook.
  - Writes down what it did in a note that says, ‚ÄúBackup: Archived root data.json and cleaned up old files.‚Äù
  - Puts everything back neatly on the shelf (pushes to the `main` branch).

---

#### **Step 7: Leave You a Note If Something Goes Wrong**
- If the robot gets stuck or something breaks:
  - It writes a ‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù note (an error log).
  - Leaves the note in your to-do list (GitHub Issues) so you can fix the problem.

---

### **Why Is This Robot Helpful?**
1. **It Keeps Your Notebook Safe**:
   - Always makes a backup before making changes.
2. **It Cleans Up for You**:
   - Regularly throws out old files you don‚Äôt need anymore.
3. **It Tells You If It‚Äôs Stuck**:
   - Leaves you a clear message if something doesn‚Äôt work.

---

### **How Do You Use It?**
- You press a button to start the robot.
- It does all the work while you relax or do something else.
- If anything goes wrong, you‚Äôll get a message telling you exactly what happened.

---

### **Why Is This Important?**
Think of this as your robot helper that keeps your stuff safe and your workspace tidy. You never have to worry about losing your important notebook or running out of room because the robot is always there to handle it. üòä
