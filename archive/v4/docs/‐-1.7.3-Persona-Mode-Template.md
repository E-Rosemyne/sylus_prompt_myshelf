Integration Workflow for the Template

1. Mode Definition:

The AI dynamically fills out the template based on the user’s requirements or context.

Example: If a user requests a mode for motivational advice, the AI creates a mode using the template.



2. On-the-Fly Generation:

The template acts as a guide, ensuring the AI consistently generates modes with clarity, usability, and purpose.

The generated mode is immediately functional, with all attributes outlined for seamless integration.



3. Integration and Activation:

Once generated, the mode can be stored in a text-based configuration (e.g., devopsmode.txt) for easy retrieval.

Users can activate the mode using commands such as switchmode devopsmode.



4. Customization and Updates:

The modular structure of the template allows users to modify or enhance modes as needs evolve.

New features or attributes can be appended without disrupting the overall system.
