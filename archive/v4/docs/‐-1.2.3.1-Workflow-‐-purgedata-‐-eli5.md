Okay, let‚Äôs talk about the **`purgedata` workflow** like we‚Äôre explaining it to a 5-year-old. Imagine you have a toy box (your project), and sometimes you need to throw out old toys (files) to keep it neat and tidy. That‚Äôs what this workflow does!

### **When Does the Toy Cleanup Happen?**
1. **When the Other Robot Finishes**:
   - After another robot (`archivedata`) finishes saving important toys, this one starts its cleanup job.
2. **When You Press a Button**:
   - You can tell it to start cleaning whenever you want.

---

### **What Does the Cleanup Robot Do?**
The robot has a checklist to follow so it doesn‚Äôt miss anything. Here‚Äôs how it works:

---

#### **Step 1: Grab the Toy Box**
- The robot opens your toy box (project files) and takes out everything to see what needs cleaning.

---

#### **Step 2: Get Ready to Work**
- It puts on its name tag (`Ziggy[bot]`) and grabs the key (called a secret token) so it can make changes to your toy box safely.

---

#### **Step 3: Throw Out a Specific Toy**
- It looks for a specific toy (the file `updates/data.json`) and tries to remove it.
- If the toy is there:
  - It carefully takes it out and writes down what it did.
  - It tells everyone, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thrown away `updates/data.json`!‚Äù
- If the toy isn‚Äôt there:
  - It says, ‚ÄúThe toy isn‚Äôt in the box, so nothing to do!‚Äù and moves on.

---

#### **Step 4: Clean Up Old Toys**
- The robot checks the `updates/` folder for toys (files) that are over 30 days old.
- It throws away the old ones to make room for new toys.
- It keeps track of how many old toys it removed and writes it down.

---

#### **Step 5: Save Changes**
- Once the robot is done cleaning, it:
  1. Packs up the toy box neatly.
  2. Sends all the changes to the big shelf where everyone can see them (the main branch).

---

#### **Step 6: Double-Check Its Work**
- The robot takes a final look to make sure it actually threw away the toy (`updates/data.json`).
- If the toy is still there, it says, ‚ÄúOops, I didn‚Äôt do my job!‚Äù and writes down the problem.
- If the toy is gone, it celebrates and says, ‚ÄúToy successfully removed!‚Äù

---

#### **Step 7: Tell You If Something Goes Wrong**
- If the robot gets stuck or something breaks, it writes a note about what went wrong (an error log).
- It leaves you a message in your to-do list (GitHub Issues) so you can fix it later.

---

### **Why Is This Robot Helpful?**
1. **Keeps Things Neat**:
   - It removes toys (files) you don‚Äôt need anymore.
2. **Cleans Up the Old Stuff**:
   - Makes sure the toy box doesn‚Äôt get too full with toys you‚Äôve forgotten about.
3. **Tells You What‚Äôs Wrong**:
   - If something doesn‚Äôt work, it writes a note so you can help fix the problem.

---

### **How Do You Use It?**
- Just let it run after the other robot (`archivedata`) finishes its job.
- Or press a button to tell it to start cleaning anytime.

### **What‚Äôs Cool About This Robot?**
It‚Äôs like a super-organized cleaner for your toy box‚Äîit knows exactly what to throw out and makes sure your space is neat and ready for new stuff. And if it ever needs help, it leaves you a clear message so you‚Äôre never in the dark! üòä
