[ELI5 - Enhancements](‐-5.0.0.1-Enhancements-‐-eli5.md)

Since you are in the AI session, you can get guidance on improving your core.json to add new commands and automations. Just make sure you have some stored copies of core.json file and prompt. The ‘backup’ folder is a good place to put them.

Remember the comment from the beginning about making calls to solutions like IFTTT? This solution here we found ourselves adding a custom action for our github repo. 

Other actions are certainly possible. 

Here's an example of a `curl` command to trigger an IFTTT webhook event:

```
curl -X POST https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{event_name}/with/key/{your_ifttt_key} \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"value1":"example_value1","value2":"example_value2","value3":"example_value3"}'
```

In this example:

* Replace `{event_name}` with the name of your IFTTT event.  
* Replace `{your_ifttt_key}` with your unique IFTTT Webhooks key.  
* The `-d` flag is used to send JSON data with the request. You can customize `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` with the data you want to send.

### **Gamification Feature Enhancement**

Adding gamification features like a point system, progress badges, and levels is an exciting idea that can significantly enhance user engagement. Here's how you might implement this:

---

### **Where to Implement?**

1. **Core.json (Best for Stability and Universal Access)**

   * **Why?**  
     * Centralizes gamification logic and configurations.  
     * Makes gamification features universally accessible across sessions and ensures consistency.  
   * **Implementation**:  
     * Define point categories, badge types, and level thresholds in `core.json`.

Example:  
```
 {
  "Gamification": {
    "Points": {
      "TaskCompletion": 10,
      "MilestoneAchievement": 50,
      "StreakBonus": 100
    },
    "Badges": {
      "Starter": "Earned 100 points",
      "Achiever": "Completed 50 tasks",
      "StreakMaster": "Maintained a streak for 30 days"
    },
    "Levels": {
      "Level1": "0-999 points",
      "Level2": "1000-4999 points",
      "Level3": "5000+ points"
    }
  }
}

```

*   
2. **Knowledge (For Enriched Responses)**

   * **Why?**  
     * Embeds contextual awareness of gamification mechanics for dynamic and conversational feedback.  
   * **Implementation**:  
     * Train or fine-tune on a dataset that includes responses like:  
       * “Congratulations\! You’ve reached Level 3: Expert.”  
       * “You’re only 100 points away from earning the ‘StreakMaster’ badge.”  
3. **Prompt (For Lightweight Contextualization)**

   * **Why?**  
     * Enables session-specific gamification without modifying the core.  
   * **Implementation**:  
     * Embed gamification prompts dynamically for user feedback:

Example:  
 Gamification Context:

Track user activities with a point system, badges, and levels.

Each task completion awards 10 points. Notify users of milestones.

*   
  * Limitations:  
    * Context resets between sessions unless integrated with session logging.

---

### **Recommended Approach**

**Hybrid Implementation**:

* **Core.json** for the backend framework (rules, thresholds, and data structure).  
* **Prompt** for session-specific gamification context and dynamic responses.  
* **Knowledge** for richer conversational integration over time.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Backend Reward Engine**:

   * Build a simple points and badge tracker tied to user activities (stored in `data.json` or a similar dynamic storage).

Example:  

```
{
  "UserProgress": {
    "Points": 1250,
    "Badges": \["Starter", "Achiever"\],
    "Streak": 15
  }
}
```

2. **Gamification Logic**:

   * Define triggers for point accumulation and milestones (e.g., task completion, streak maintenance).  
   * Automate badge and level calculations based on thresholds.  
3. **Dynamic Feedback**:

   * Create feedback templates in prompt or knowledge:  
     * “You’ve earned X points for completing Y tasks this week\!”  
     * “Keep it up\! You’re 50 points away from your next badge.”  
4. **UI Integration (Optional)**:

   * Add a user dashboard or progress tracker for visual engagement.

---

### **Example Interaction**

**User:** “What’s my progress this week?”  
**Ziggy:** “Great work\! You’ve earned 150 points and maintained a 5-day streak. Only 50 points left to reach Level 2\!”
