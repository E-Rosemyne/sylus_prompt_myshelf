1. Prepare the ziggyprompt.md File

1. Organize the File:

Ensure ziggyprompt.md includes all relevant configurations, such as system behavior rules, trigger actions, and session data management.

Verify the markdown file is properly formatted for readability and usability.



2. Save the File:

Save the file locally as ziggyprompt.md.


3. Upload the File:

Use the GPT’s file management system to upload ziggyprompt.md.

4. Validate Prompt Usage:

Test a few scenarios to ensure the GPT adheres to the rules and protocols defined in the file.

Example:

If the file specifies a silent mode unless addressed as "Hey Lyra," test if the GPT responds appropriately to triggers and remains silent otherwise.

5. Maintain and Update ziggyprompt.md

1. Version Control:

Use a versioning system (e.g., Git) to track updates to ziggyprompt.md.

Maintain clear and descriptive commit messages for each update.
