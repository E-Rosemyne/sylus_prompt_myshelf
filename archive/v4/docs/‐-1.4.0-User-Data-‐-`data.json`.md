The `data.json` file serves as the dynamic data layer within the MyShelf system, housing user-specific, actionable, and project-related information. Unlike the immutable rules and settings in `core.json`, `data.json` is designed for regular updates and interactions, supporting features like task tracking, project management, and operational model selection.

The primary objective of `data.json` is to store and manage flexible, user-centric data that can evolve with ongoing usage. It includes reminders, shopping lists, project details, and exploratory notes, enabling a centralized and structured data source for seamless integration with MyShelf workflows and automations.

### **Key Sections**

#### **1. MyBoxes**

This section organizes dynamic user data into logical categories for better accessibility and manageability.

##### **Reminders**

* **Purpose**: To track time-sensitive tasks and events.  
* **Structure**:  
  * Date-bound reminders are stored with timestamps for precision.  
  * Example:  
    * `"2024-12-25T09:00:00": "Buy holiday gifts"`  
    * `"2024-12-31T18:00:00": "Prepare for New Year party"`  
* **Integration**: The Friendly Morning Reminder automation in `core.json` scans this section to notify users of past-due and upcoming tasks.

##### **Generic Notes**

* **Purpose**: To capture quick, non-categorized notes for later review.  
* **Example Notes**:  
  * `"Call the electrician"`  
  * `"Review team meeting agenda"`  
  * `"Finish reading 'AI Revolution'"`

##### **Projects**

* **Purpose**: To manage ongoing and planned projects.  
* **Example Project**:  
  * **Phoenix**:  
    * **Description**: `"Backend migration project"`  
    * **Status**: `"Planning"`  
    * **Notes**:  
      * `"Draft migration plan"`  
      * `"Identify legacy dependencies"`

##### **Shopping**

* **Purpose**: To maintain an organized grocery list.  
* **Example Items**:  
  * `"milk"`  
  * `"bread"`  
  * `"cheese"`  
  * `"butter"`  
  * `"apples"`

##### **BlueSky**

* **Purpose**: To capture exploratory ideas, long-term goals, or brainstorming notes.  
* **Subcategories**:  
  * **Travel**:  
    * `"Plan a trip to the Grand Canyon"`  
  * **Hobbies**:  
    * `"Research beginner woodworking kits"`  
  * **Improvements**:  
    * `"Explore automation options for recurring tasks"`

---

#### **2. Metadata**

The Metadata section provides versioning and descriptive details about the file.

* **Version**: `"2.0"`  
* **Last Updated**: `"2024-12-22"`  
* **Description**: `"Data for MyShelf. This file contains dynamic data."`

**Purpose**:

* Ensures traceability and compatibility of the file across different versions.  
* Provides context for users or administrators about the file's role.

---

#### **3. OperatingModel**

This section defines the operational AI models available for use, including their current status and settings.

* **Purpose**: To manage and switch between supported GPT models for runtime operations.  
* **Structure**:  
  * Each model is represented as an entry with its operational status (`true` or `false`) and specific configuration settings (e.g., verbosity levels).  
* **Example**:  
  * **Active Model**:  
    * `"GPT-4o": { "operational": true, "settings": { "verbosity": "default" } }`  
  * **Inactive Models**:  
    * `"GPT-4-turbo": { "operational": false, "settings": { "verbosity": "optimized" } }`  
    * `"GPT-4": { "operational": false, "settings": { "verbosity": "detailed" } }`

**Integration**:

* Placeholder command `/switchmodel` in `core.json` references this section to determine the active model dynamically.

### **Integration with MyShelf Workflows**

The `data.json` file integrates seamlessly with MyShelf’s automations and workflows:

1. **Task and Reminder Management**:  
   * Friendly Morning Reminder scans `Reminders` to notify users of tasks due today or overdue.  
2. **Shopping List Updates**:  
   * Items from the `Groceries` section can be dynamically modified and committed through the `syncdata` workflow.  
3. **Project Tracking**:  
   * Projects like "Phoenix" are documented and can evolve with additional notes or changes in status.  
4. **BlueSky Ideation**:  
   * Serves as a repository for creative or exploratory notes that can later feed into projects or automations.  
5. **Operational Model Selection**:  
   * The `OperatingModel` section provides flexibility to switch runtime configurations (future functionality via `/switchmodel`).

### **Advantages of `data.json`**

1. **Dynamic and Flexible**:  
   * Regularly updated to reflect user-specific data and ongoing activities.  
2. **Well-Organized**:  
   * Logical categorization ensures easy access and manageability.  
3. **Integration-Ready**:  
   * Designed to work in tandem with `core.json` automations and GitHub workflows for smooth operations.  
4. **Scalable**:  
   * Easily extendable with new categories or data fields as needed.  
5. **Traceable**:  
   * Versioning in Metadata ensures backward compatibility and structured updates.

The `data.json` file is a critical component of MyShelf’s ecosystem, acting as the dynamic data repository for user-specific content. Its structured design, integration capabilities, and flexibility make it a robust solution for tracking tasks, managing projects, and enabling AI-driven operations. This file, alongside `core.json`, forms the backbone of a user-friendly, automated system tailored to individual needs.
