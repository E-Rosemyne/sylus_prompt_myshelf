Education & Learning:

Create features for students or professionals to track learning goals.

Example:

"Read 10 chapters of [Book Title] by [date]. Completed: 7 chapters."

"Watch 3 tutorials on Python this week."

**Simplified JSON Structure for Learning Goals**

```json
{
  "LearningTracker": {
    "Goals": [
      {
        "Title": "Read 10 chapters of 'Clean Code'",
        "Target": 10,
        "Progress": 7,
        "Deadline": "2024-12-31",
        "Notes": "Focus on chapters about refactoring."
      },
      {
        "Title": "Watch 3 Python tutorials",
        "Target": 3,
        "Progress": 1,
        "Deadline": "2024-12-29",
        "Notes": "Cover basics of data structures."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Natural Language Prompts for Simple Use**

**1. Adding a New Goal**
   - **Prompt**: "Hey Ziggy, I want to read 10 chapters of 'Clean Code' by December 31. Log this as a learning goal."
   - **Response**: 
     "Got it! I’ve added the goal: 'Read 10 chapters of Clean Code' with a deadline of December 31. Progress is set to 0/10. Let me know when you’re ready to update it!"

**2. Updating Progress**
   - **Prompt**: "Hey Ziggy, I’ve read 3 more chapters of 'Clean Code.'"
   - **Response**: 
     "Great job! I’ve updated your progress to 7/10 chapters for 'Clean Code.' Just 3 more to go!"

**3. Listing Goals**
   - **Prompt**: "Hey Ziggy, what are my current learning goals?"
   - **Response**:
     "Here’s what you’re working on:  
     1. 'Read 10 chapters of Clean Code' — Progress: 7/10 (Deadline: Dec 31)  
     2. 'Watch 3 Python tutorials' — Progress: 1/3 (Deadline: Dec 29)"

**Visualization Options**

**1. Progress Bars**
   - **Example**:  
     "You’re 70% done with 'Clean Code' and 33% done with Python tutorials."

  - Each goal is a single entry with simple fields: `Title`, `Target`, `Progress`, `Deadline`, and optional `Notes`.
- **User-Friendly Prompts**:
  - Natural language commands make it easy to add, update, or review goals.
- **Expandable**:
  - Can be enhanced later with categories (e.g., "Books," "Tutorials") or reminders.
