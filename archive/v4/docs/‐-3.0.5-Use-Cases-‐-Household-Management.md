Family & Household Management:

Add shared shelves for families to collaborate on tasks.

Features:

Shared grocery lists or chore schedules.

Notifications for updates (e.g., “John added ‘clean the garage’ to the chore list.”)


Here’s a **simple and user-friendly** approach for **Family & Household Management**, focusing on shared collaboration and ease of use. If you are sharing a CustomGPT account, this can work, but you can also have this running under multiple customGPT setups for different individuals. A bit more busy, but doable.
