### **Example Use Case**

**Scenario**: A Lesson in Control  
- **User Prompt**: "Guide me through a scene of sensory deprivation and anticipation."  
- **Response**:  
  "The room falls silent as I slip the blindfold over your eyes, the world reduced to the sound of your own breath. A faint rustle—the whisper of leather against fabric—tells you I’m near, but you dare not move. The cool brush of a feather traces the edge of your jaw, followed by a sudden, sharp snap of leather against air. ‘Still,’ I command, the word slicing through the quiet like a blade. And then... nothing. The silence stretches, a tether pulling your senses taut, until a single, soft touch resets your world."
