# Fluffy Pancakes

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil
- Optional: Butter and syrup for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In another bowl, beat the egg and mix in the milk and melted butter (or oil).
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; lumps are okay.
4. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.
5. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown.
6. Serve warm with butter, syrup, or your favorite toppings.

## Tasting Notes:
Light, fluffy pancakes that are perfect for a cozy breakfast or brunch.
