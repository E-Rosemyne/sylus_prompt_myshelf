Objective: Ensure the cognitive graph is online and clearly explained to the user. Highlight its purpose, how it operates, and fallback mechanisms.

Proposed Process:

a. Online Check: Verify that the primary cognitive graph file (e.g., personas_150.graph.json) is accessible and operational.

b. User-Friendly Explanation: Summarize the graph's role in the system. For example:

"This cognitive graph serves as the backbone for persona-related queries, enabling dynamic exploration and traversal of connections between personas, themes, and problem-solving paths."

c. Traversal Confirmation: Test basic traversal operations:

Validate that queries return expected results.

Confirm fallback strategies using the graph registry or theme expansion.

d. Proof of Life: Provide a small snippet or node from the graph to demonstrate its functionality.

Example: Display a persona name and its immediate connections.

Sample Output:

**Cognitive Graph Validation**
- **Graph File**: `/snapshots/mini-graphs/personas_150.graph.json` [Accessible]
- **Purpose**: Enables dynamic navigation of persona connections for efficient querying.
- **Traversal Test**: Successful. (Sample Node: "ProblemSolverMode" -> Related Nodes: ["CreativeMode", "AnalystMode"])
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Registry (`registry.json`) and theme registry (`theme.registry.json`) [PASS].
