## Siteheld Situation

Scenario Focus: Why do objects float?

Learning Reasoning: A group of children is curious why some objects float in water while others sink. This scenario establishes a problem for explaining buoyancy to children in a simple and engaging way.


 - ** Systems Diagram and Types **
  The domain focuses on classification techniques in LL prompting systems, including ELI5 methods such as Role Prompting, simple responses, and clear framing. These promptings are implemented in context where children ask scientific but simple questions about why things float.

  Tool Maps:
  - Z-shot Analysis: Provides a basic response from the model without any provided examples.
Key Focus are buoyancy, density, and shape. These are explained using fun analogies such as the gentle hug analogy.
