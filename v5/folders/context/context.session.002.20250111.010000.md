# Session Audit

This session includes the following audit information:

- **Observations**:
  - The graph clearly contained a reference to the `gluten-free_pancakes.md` file.
  - During the incident, the graph assumed that all queries were focused only on "breakfast" or "pancakes." This led to overlooking other relevant nodes.
  - Limited keyword search and failed to detect probable matches in the graph.
  - No dynamic adaptation or semantic reasoning was utilized to explore connected graph nodes.

- **Resolution Strategy**:
  - Adaptive search configurations were updated to avoid specific terms.
  - Navigation JSON was modified to add adaptive exploration rules.

## Next Steps:
Reinitialize the session based on the updated configurations. Review strategy and test adaptive search.
