# The Graph Module Revision

The graph module is central to the cognitive mapping and organization within Project MyShelf. The revisions and upgrades are designed to address gaps, improve semantic connections, and enable innovative, efficient, and aligned graph structures.

The following components are updated:
- Bidirectional Links: Enabled and support discovery from multiple points.
- Semantic Enrichment: Relationships are enriched with keywords and themes.
- Dynamic Mini-Graph Generation: Process for creating and maintaining mini-graphs is centralized.
- Graph Pruning: Removes redundancy and overlapping links to streamline the graph structure.
- Integration: Explicit connections to the navigation and commons modules.

These changes enable even more efficient graph processing, improved data retrieval, and aligned workflows.

The revised graph module is now active on GitHub under the path context.
