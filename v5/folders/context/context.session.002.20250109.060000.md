### Engineered Prompt Techniques for Software Engineering

This context includes a detailed recap of prompt techniques specific to software engineering, enriching their usage, strengths, and potential weaknesses.

The session covered various techniques and categories, such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Thought Generation, Ensembling, maintaining confidence and clarity in real-world software problem-solving.

## Tool Areas Focus:

- **Zero-Shot Techniques:** Involves instruction without using elements for getting accurate outputs.
  - Common issues: inconsistency, use cases when examples seem off, providing a limited view.
- **Few-Shot Techniques:** Rely on examples to reinforce response and guaranteeng consistency. 
  - Potential weaknesses include good examples vs poorly-chosen set of exemplars.

 - Exhemplar Generation: Submitted examples refined:
    example: 1) question from client 2) a response that corrected original clarity.

 - **Thought Generation Techniques:* Used to help encourage a multi-step reasoning process.
 - Chain-of-Thought: Broke into steps without skipping log using simple tasks.
