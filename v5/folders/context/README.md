this folder contains your enriched context session information. before end your current session, ask your AI Assistant this:

`save enriched context session ensuring full narrative and story telling from the beginning of our session then prepare for publishing. prompt for my confirmation of publishing by sharing the upload path`

or something to that effect. It should tell you it is publshing to the context/ path and the name of the file. That file naming convention should match this pattern:

`context.session.###.YYYYMMDD.{timestamp}.md`

example:

`context.session.001.20250124.062324.md`
