folder for backups of your data.json. these should auto purge based upon your repo environment variable called CLEANUP_PERIOD. If they don't, you can manually delete from the repository as needed. These are created when you upload the data.json file to the updates path. The workflow validates your data.json and then copies it to the root path, and to the backup path with a timestamp. then it deletes the file. this way you always have an emergency backup in case something goes wrong - you can recover.
