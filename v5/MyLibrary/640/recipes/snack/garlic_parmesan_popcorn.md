# Savory Popcorn with Garlic and Parmesan

## Ingredients:
- ½ cup popcorn kernels
- 2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (optional)
- Salt to taste

## Instructions:
1. **Pop the Corn**:  
   - Heat the olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium-high heat.  
   - Add the popcorn kernels and cover with a lid. Shake the pot occasionally to prevent burning.  
   - Once the popping slows, remove the pot from heat and let it sit until popping stops completely.

2. **Prepare the Garlic Butter**:  
   - In a small pan, sauté the minced garlic in 1 tablespoon of butter or olive oil until fragrant (about 1-2 minutes). Be careful not to burn the garlic.

3. **Mix and Season**:  
   - Pour the popcorn into a large bowl. Drizzle the garlic butter over the popcorn and toss to coat.  
   - Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and Italian herbs (if using) over the top, tossing again to distribute evenly.  
   - Add salt to taste.

4. **Serve and Enjoy**:  
   - Serve immediately in a large bowl, perfect for sharing during your movie night!

## Tasting Notes:
A savory, crispy snack with the perfect balance of cheesy, garlicky goodness. Great for cozy movie nights!
