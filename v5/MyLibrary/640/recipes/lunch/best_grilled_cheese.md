# The Best Grilled Cheese Sandwich Ever

## Ingredients:
- 2 slices of high-quality bread (sourdough or brioche works best)
- 2-3 oz sharp cheddar cheese (grated for even melting)
- 1 oz gruyère or fontina cheese (optional, for extra creaminess)
- 2 tablespoons butter (softened)
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise (optional, for extra crispiness)
- Optional add-ons: caramelized onions, crispy bacon, tomato slices, or fresh herbs like thyme

## Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Bread**:  
   Spread a thin layer of softened butter on one side of each bread slice. For extra crispiness, spread a thin layer of mayonnaise over the butter.

2. **Assemble the Sandwich**:  
   Place the grated cheddar and gruyère (if using) on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread. Add optional toppings like caramelized onions or bacon, then top with the second slice of bread (buttered side out).

3. **Preheat the Pan**:  
   Heat a non-stick skillet or cast-iron pan over medium heat.

4. **Grill the Sandwich**:  
   Place the sandwich in the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on one side, pressing lightly with a spatula. Flip carefully and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until both sides are golden brown and the cheese is melted.

5. **Serve and Enjoy**:  
   Let the sandwich rest for a minute before slicing. Serve with a bowl of tomato soup or a side of pickles for the ultimate experience.

## Tips for the Ultimate Grilled Cheese:
- Grating the cheese helps it melt faster and more evenly.
- Cooking on medium heat ensures the bread gets crispy without burning while the cheese melts perfectly.
- Experiment with different cheese combinations to find your favorite flavor balance.
