# Garlic Butter Steak with Herb Potatoes

## Ingredients:
- 2 (8 oz) steaks (ribeye or sirloin work great)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- Fresh thyme or rosemary (a few sprigs)
- Salt and black pepper to taste

**For the Potatoes**:
- 1 lb baby potatoes, halved
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Potatoes**:  
   - Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).  
   - Toss the halved potatoes with olive oil, garlic powder, dried thyme, salt, and pepper.  
   - Spread them on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.

2. **Cook the Steaks**:  
   - Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper.  
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.  
   - Sear the steaks for 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare (adjust for your preferred doneness).  
   - Reduce heat to medium, add butter, minced garlic, and fresh thyme or rosemary. Spoon the melted butter over the steaks as they cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.

3. **Rest and Serve**:  
   - Transfer the steaks to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes.  
   - Serve with the roasted potatoes and drizzle the garlic butter from the skillet over the steak.
