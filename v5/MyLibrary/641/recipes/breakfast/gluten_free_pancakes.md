# Gluten-Free Pancakes

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour (ensure it includes xanthan gum)
- 2 tablespoons sugar (optional for sweetness)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk (or dairy-free alternative)
- 1 egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil
- Optional: Butter, syrup, or fresh fruit for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In another bowl, beat the egg and mix in the milk and melted butter (or oil). Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
3. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.
4. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown.
5. Serve warm with your favorite gluten-free toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or a dollop of yogurt.

## Tasting Notes:
Fluffy, light, and delicious pancakes perfect for anyone looking for a gluten-free breakfast option.
