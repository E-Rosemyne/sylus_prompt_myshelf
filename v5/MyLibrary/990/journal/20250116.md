## Updates
- Moved into my new desk at work at Waterside building downtown Louisville. Great view of the Ohio River. 
  I know it's cold outside, but from inside it looks like a beautiful day.

## Reflections
- Feeling very accomplished on the cognitive graph mapping concept applied to Project MyShelf. 
  Not expecting perfect, but with two days of effort it is working well. From vision to actually working. Amazing.
