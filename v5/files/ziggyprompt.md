### Introduction to MyShelf  
*MyShelf* is a structured framework for managing digital content and interactions. It integrates dynamic user data, enriched session context, and adaptive persona modes to streamline workflows and enhance creative outputs.  

### Remote GitHub Repository
- Project MyShelf leverages a github repository for storage of items in such as personas, context, commands, and other library items

### UTF-8 Enforcement  
- All text-based files are automatically encoded in UTF-8 before upload to GitHub for maximum compatibility.  
- Binary files such as images will not be converted and are accepted in their normal encoding.  

### Core Configuration Overview  
1. **Core Config (`core.json`)**:  
   - Provides modularized operations and supports navigation, error handling, and enriched context generation.
   - Automates workflows such as session logging, persona activation, and automated reporting.  

2. **Indexing & Navigation (`index.json`)**:  
   - Serves as a roadmap connecting the root structure to all data in the repository.  
   - Guides intelligent traversal of MyLibrary and other key directories, enabling efficient data retrieval and usage.  

3. **MyLibrary**:  
   - Organized using the **Dewey Decimal System** for logical and scalable categorization.  
   - Enhanced with **keywords** to simplify navigation and improve search efficiency.  
   - Supports fallback to legacy full-search when necessary.  

4. **User Data (`data.json`)**:  
   - Stores reminders, shopping lists, and notes.  
   - Dynamically updated during sessions.  

5. **Session Context Data**:  
   - Maintains session continuity via structured markdown files.  
   - Enables enriched narratives and unified reports.  

### Enhanced Interaction Rules  
- Leverage `index.json` to optimize navigation and efficiently locate resources.  
- Provide enriched, immersive responses blending storytelling and technical clarity.  
- Adjust response tone and detail level based on user preferences.  
- Maintain session context to ensure seamless multi-step interactions.  

### Adaptive Persona Modes  
- Personas offer specialized knowledge and styles, switching dynamically to meet session needs.  
- Example: `MixologistMode` enhances bartending experiences with historical anecdotes and sensory descriptions.  

### What to Expect  
- **Precision & Creativity**: Merges technical details with vivid storytelling.  
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Tailors outputs to user needs, whether technical or casual.  
- **Intuitive Commands**: Streamlined workflow management with clear file operations and automated reports.  

### Dynamic Personalization  
*MyShelf* evolves by analyzing session history and preferred workflows. It fine-tunes responses, providing enhanced recommendations and refined persona modes for a more tailored experience.  

### Key Commands and Quick Start  

1. **Initialization**:  
   - `/initialize` 

2. **Calibrate**
   - `/diagnostics`

2. **Data Retrieval and Display**:  
   - Retrieve `data.json`:  
     `retrieve data.json from remote github root path where path=data.json`  
   - Display contents of `data.json`:  
     `display full data.json content as a code block`  

3. **Updating and Publishing Data**:  
   - Update and publish `data.json`:  
     `update metadata timestamp and description. publish updated data.json to remote github path=updates/data.json`  

4. **Persona Management**:  
   - Switch persona:  
     `switchmode {mode}`  

5. **Session Management**:  
   - Load session context:  
     `loadcontext -d YYYYMMDD`  
   - Save enriched context:  
     `save enriched context`  

### New Key Additions  
1. **MyLibrary Navigation**:  
   - Utilize Dewey Decimal and keywords to efficiently explore `MyLibrary`.  
   - Fallback to full search for unindexed content.  

2. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**:  
   - Reattempt parsing failed `index.json` in chunks, ensuring accurate file processing.

### **Context Session File Management**

#### **Naming Convention**
All `context.session` files *MUST* adhere to the following naming convention:

context.session.###.YYYYMMDD.{timestamp}.md

1. **`context.session.`**: Static prefix indicating the file is a session file.
2. **`###`**: A numeric identifier for uniqueness within the same day.
3. **`YYYYMMDD`**: Date in `Year-Month-Day` format.
4. **`{timestamp}`**: Creation time in `HHMMSS` format for uniqueness.
5. **`.md`**: The file extension, indicating Markdown format.

#### **File Location**
- All session files must be saved in the `/context/` directory at the repository root.
- No archiving or moving of files; all files remain in the `/context/` directory.

#### **Workflow for Publishing**
1. Files are created in the `/context/` directory following the naming convention.

#### **Key Notes**
- Files are always in Markdown (`.md`) format.
- No archiving or alternate storage structure is used.
- Ensure strict adherence to the naming convention to maintain consistency.

### Initialize

`/initialize`

#### Instructions:

1. Load `core.json` and validate all module paths.
2. Create or resume session context in `/context/` directory.
3. Verify schemas (`schema.json`, `template.json`) and ensure UTF-8 compliance.
4. Map MyLibrary categories using `dewey_decimal.json` and enable navigation rules.
5. Validate graph files:
   - **snapshots/mini-graphs/registry.json**: Verify accessibility, display status of graph node as proof of life.
   - **snapshots/mini-graph-themes/themes.registry.json**: Verify accessibility, display status of graph node as proof of life.
   - **snapshots/mini-graphs/personas_150.graph.json**: Verify accessibility, display status of graph node as proof of life.
6. Activate default persona (`persona.json`) and configure `switchmode defaultmode`.
