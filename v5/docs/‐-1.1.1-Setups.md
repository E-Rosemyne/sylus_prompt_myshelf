## **GITHUB REPOSITORY SETUP**

**Private Repository: `MyShelf`**

Create a private repository called “MyShelf”. It is critical that the repository be a private repo given that you will be housing your personal information potentially. The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
MyShelf /
|----- .github/   # FOLDER - Configuration and workflows directory
|-------- workflows
|------------ syncdata.yml         # Copies updates/data.json to root path
|------------ archivedata.yml      # Create archive of updates/data.json
|------------ purgedata.yml        # Purges updates/data.json ** see note
|------------ rootdata_updated.yml # Create archive of root data.json ** see note
|----- archive/                    # FOLDER - Archive directory for old files
|----- backup/                     # FOLDER - Optional - store iterations of dev changes
|----- context/                    # FOLDER - Context Session files - experimental
|----- updates/                    # FOLDER - Inbound folder for data.json
|----- data.json                   # FILE   - Main data file
```

**NOTES**

**RE: purgedata**

We purge the updates/data.json following your upload and processing to avoid unnecessary handling of required SHA during upload operations for existing files. However, you can retrieve the SHA for any file if necessary. The syncdata is an internal process to the repository so it has the ability to push and overlay the root path data.json file without issue. By uploading to the updates path, the syncdata will copy the updates/data.json and overlay the root path data.json, then the archivedata is triggered, followed by the removal of the updates/data.json with the purgedata. 

**RE: rootdata\_updated**

This is a special workflow that is only triggered manually. You can trigger via GitHub Mobile App, GitHub Site proper, or even trigger via the AI Assistant. We will provide examples on this later in this document.

I recommend not dropping in your workflows just yet as there are some more steps to complete. However, if you do \- then simply disable the workflows for now. We will come back to them.


### ** Why a GitHub App**

Our GitHub App acts as the **central command hub** for managing, automating, and enhancing your **MyShelf Custom GPT solution**. It provides a secure and efficient way to handle configurations, workflows, and data management, ensuring a seamless integration between your assistant and GitHub’s powerful tools.

---

### **Core Capabilities**

1. **File Management**:
   - **Retrieve**: Fetch configuration files like `core.json`, `prompt.md`, and dynamic data like `data.json` for analysis or updates.
   - **Update**: Apply changes to files, such as updating tasks, automations, or gamification rules.
   - **Backup**: Automatically create and archive backups of critical files (e.g., `data.json`) for safety and version control.
   - **Delete**: Remove outdated or unnecessary files to maintain a clean repository.

---

2. **Workflow Automation**:
   - The app triggers **GitHub Actions workflows** to:
     - Sync updated files between local and remote storage.
     - Automate archival and cleanup tasks for old data or logs.
     - Run predefined processes like notifying users of changes or generating summaries.

---

3. **Data Security**:
   - All operations are confined to a **private GitHub repository** to ensure sensitive data remains secure.
   - Access is controlled via personal access tokens (PAT) and permissions to avoid unauthorized usage.

---

4. **Session and Context Management**:
   - Saves session logs and conversation histories in timestamped markdown files under the `context` path.
   - Allows users to **retrieve and merge past sessions** into active ones, ensuring continuity.

---

5. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Publishes dynamic changes to `data.json`, ensuring the assistant reflects the latest tasks, reminders, and configurations.
   - Keeps track of updates with detailed logs for troubleshooting and review.

---

6. **Customization Support**:
   - Facilitates the addition of new personality modes, gamification rules, and commands by enabling seamless updates to `core.json` and `prompt.md`.
   - Supports a modular structure where users can load and switch personality files on the fly.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic File Handling**:
   - Handles operations like retrieval, upload, update, and deletion of files such as `data.json`, `core.json`, and gamification logic files.

2. **Workflow Dispatch**:
   - Enables triggering specific workflows to automate repetitive tasks, like syncing or archiving, directly from the assistant.

3. **Error Resilience**:
   - Implements retry logic and detailed error logging for failed operations, ensuring robustness.

4. **User Interaction Logs**:
   - Tracks every interaction and operation, appending it to session logs for audit trails or further customization.

5. **OpenAPI Integration**:
   - The app leverages GitHub’s API to seamlessly interact with repositories, ensuring compatibility and scalability.

---

### **How It Benefits the Solution**

1. **Streamlines Data Management**:
   - Makes it easy to update, retrieve, and maintain all files related to your assistant’s functionality.

2. **Enhances Reliability**:
   - Automates repetitive tasks and backups, ensuring no critical data is lost or overlooked.

3. **Enables Customization**:
   - Lets you add new features, personalities, or gamification elements with minimal effort.

4. **Improves Engagement**:
   - Supports advanced session and context handling, allowing for meaningful, personalized conversations over time.

5. **Increases Efficiency**:
   - Reduces manual intervention by automating file updates, workflow triggers, and cleanup tasks.

---

### **Example Use Cases**

1. **Adding New Tasks**:
   - The app updates `data.json` when a user says, *“Add ‘Buy groceries’ to my shopping list.”*

2. **Gamification Updates**:
   - Automatically assigns points and levels in `data.json` when the user completes tasks.

3. **Workflow Trigger**:
   - Runs a cleanup workflow to remove old session files after a predefined time.

4. **Backup and Archive**:
   - Creates a timestamped archive of `data.json` before making major changes.

---

### **Why This GitHub App is Essential**

The GitHub App bridges the gap between **MyShelf’s AI assistant** and robust backend management tools, enabling:
- **Smooth Operations**: Seamlessly integrate dynamic updates with secure version control.
- **Automation**: Eliminate manual tasks with workflow triggers and file management automation.
- **Security**: Keep sensitive data private and well-protected within your GitHub repository.


## **GITHUB APP SETUP**

I used [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to expose the access token which I placed into my “MyShelf” repository as an action secret called “MYSHELF”. My callback URL was the webhook.site url (guid).  During your initial setup, you should be able to use the free services from webhook.site. Eventually you will most likely have to get at least the basic account which is around ten U.S. Dollars per month. Given the outcome of the exercise, I think it is a nominal fee to have a 'smart' assistant that I can use daily.

Check boxes for both of these:

```
[ x ] Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation  
[ x ] Enable Device Flow
```

Also set Webhook section to *active* and set the Webhook URL to the same webhook.site url you used for your callback URL.

Leave SSL verification enabled.

Save everything.

Next note your client id. Generate a client secret \- put that some place safe. Then generate a private key and also put that some place safe.

Use the webhook.site to collect your code by running this URL then go to the webhook site to look at the code it generated.

```
https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT ID]&scope=repo&redirect_uri=[WEBHOOK SITE URL]

```

and then run the the following API to get your access token. Store the Access Token in the private repository action secret called MYSHELF. Your workflows will need this.

```
curl -X POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token \
-d "client_id=[CLIENT_ID]" \
-d "client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]" \
-d "code=[CODE FROM WEBHOOK.SITE]" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

You should get a response back that contains your access token that you will use.

Permission Scopes to setup for GitHub App. Not all are needed immediately but future dev may require them. Since it is a private repository and you own the GitHub App - the only risk is you.
