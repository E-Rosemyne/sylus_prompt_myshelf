## **GITHUB REPOSITORY SETUP**

**Private Repository: `MyShelf`**

Create a private repository called “MyShelf”. It is critical that the repository be a private repo given that you will be housing your personal information potentially. The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
MyShelf /
|----- .gitignore                            # FILE - This ignores any log files during git commit operations
|----- barebones.data.json                   # FILE - This is a starter data.json with nothing filled in, but you can use the data.json provided too
|----- core.json                             # FILE - This is your core.json file. It is placed here in the root and also attached to your Custom GPT
|----- data.json                             # FILE - This is you mutable data.json. It is meant for light and frequently changing information
|----- index.json                            # FILE - The `index.json` file is a key file throughout the system to assist with navigation
|----- README.md                             # FILE - Just notes about MyShelf with some reminders. Non-critical file, but the notes are important.
|----- schema.json                           # FILE - The schema.json and template.json help keep your data.json in spec
|----- template.json                         # FILE - The schema.json and template.json help keep your data.json in spec
|----- TEMPLATE.md                           # FILE - This file explains the template
|----- ziggyprompt.md                        # FILE - This is your prompt. It is used in the Custom GPT, attached, as well as placed here in root.
|----- .github/                              # FOLDER - Configuration and workflows directory
|-------- workflows                          # FOLDER - workflows
|---------- dataworkflow.yml                 # FILE - Copies updates/data.json to root path
|---------- generate_core_graph.yml          # FILE - Scans key folders and generates your core graph
|---------- generate_mini_graphs.yml         # FILE - Scans your core graph and creates smaller mini graphs, and creates registry.json
|---------- generate_cache_graph.yml         # FILE - Scans context session files and creates theme.registry.json
|---------- generate_cognitive_graph_map.yml # FILE - This is a wrapper workflow that runs all three core, mini, and cache graph workflows
|---------- rootdata_updated.yml             # FILE - Create archive of root data.json ** see note
|----- archive/                              # FOLDER - Archive directory for old data.json files
|----- context/                              # FOLDER - Context Session files - experimental
|----- modules/                              # FOLDER - Modules are called from the core.json
|----- commands/                             # FOLDER - These command prompts are used during diagnostics on start up
|----- MyLibrary/                            # FOLDER - This is a keyfolder containing all of your mutable large volume content beyond your data.json
|----- scripts/                              # FOLDER - This folder contains your python scripts
|----- snapshots/                            # FOLDER - This will contain your graphs after you run your graph workflows
|----- updates/                              # FOLDER - Inbound folder for data.json
```

**NOTES**

**RE: purging the updates/data.json**

We purge the updates/data.json following your upload and processing to avoid unnecessary handling of required SHA during upload operations for existing files. However, you can retrieve the SHA for any file if necessary. The syncdata is an internal process to the repository so it has the ability to push and overlay the root path data.json file without issue. By uploading to the updates path, the syncdata will copy the updates/data.json and overlay the root path data.json, then the archivedata is triggered, followed by the removal of the updates/data.json with the purgedata. 

**RE: rootdata\_updated**

This is a special workflow that is only triggered manually. You can trigger via GitHub Mobile App, GitHub Site proper, or even trigger via the AI Assistant. We will provide examples on this later in this document.

I recommend not dropping in your workflows just yet as there are some more steps to complete. However, if you do \- then simply disable the workflows for now. We will come back to them.


### ** Why a GitHub App**

Our GitHub App acts as the **central command hub** for managing, automating, and enhancing your **MyShelf Custom GPT solution**. It provides a secure and efficient way to handle configurations, workflows, and data management, ensuring a seamless integration between your assistant and GitHub’s powerful tools.

You can use a personal access token and not take the GitHub App approach, however I found that the PAT alone wasn't as stable and consistent. Using the GitHub App approach, seems to work much better despite some the technical overhead building it.

Using a Personal Access Token : Free
Using a GitHub App approach : Free/Small cost. You need a place for the callback url and to pick up the access token. I went with Webhook.site which was $9 a month. Nominal cost for me. If you have options to access a similar setup for no cost - use it instead.

---

### **Core Capabilities**

1. **File Management**:
   - **Retrieve**: Fetch configuration files like  `data.json` for analysis/updates or other files from MyLibrary.
   - **Update**: Apply changes to files such as `data.json` or files in your MyLibrary.
   - **Backup**: Automatically create and archive backups of `data.json` for safety and version control.
   - **Delete**: Remove outdated or unnecessary files to maintain a clean repository.

---

2. **Workflow Automation**:
   - The app triggers **GitHub Actions workflows** to:
     - Sync updated files between local and remote storage.
     - Automate archival and cleanup tasks for old data or logs.
     - Run predefined processes like notifying users of changes or generating summaries.

---

3. **Data Security**:
   - All operations are confined to a **private GitHub repository** to ensure sensitive data remains secure.
   - Access is controlled via personal access tokens (PAT) and permissions to avoid unauthorized usage.

---

4. **Session and Context Management**:
   - Saves session logs and conversation histories in timestamped markdown files under the `context` path.
   - Allows users to **retrieve and merge past sessions** into active ones, ensuring continuity.

---

5. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Publishes dynamic changes to `data.json`, ensuring the assistant reflects the latest tasks, reminders, and configurations.
   - Keeps track of updates with detailed logs for troubleshooting and review.

---

6. **Customization Support**:
   - Supports a modular structure where users can load and switch personality files on the fly.

---

### **Why This GitHub App is Essential**

The GitHub App bridges the gap between **MyShelf’s AI assistant** and robust backend management tools, enabling:
- **Smooth Operations**: Seamlessly integrate dynamic updates with secure version control.
- **Automation**: Eliminate manual tasks with workflow triggers and file management automation.
- **Security**: Keep sensitive data private and well-protected within your GitHub repository.


## **GITHUB APP SETUP**

I used [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to expose the access token which I placed into my “MyShelf” repository as an action secret called “MYSHELF”. My callback URL was the webhook.site url (guid).  During your initial setup, you should be able to use the free services from webhook.site. Eventually you will most likely have to get at least the basic account which is around ten U.S. Dollars per month. Given the outcome of the exercise, I think it is a nominal fee to have a 'smart' assistant that I can use daily.

Check boxes for both of these:

```
[ x ] Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation  
[ x ] Enable Device Flow
```

Also set Webhook section to *active* and set the Webhook URL to the same webhook.site url you used for your callback URL.

Leave SSL verification enabled.

Save everything.

Next note your client id. Generate a client secret \- put that some place safe. Then generate a private key and also put that some place safe.

Use the webhook.site to collect your code by running this URL then go to the webhook site to look at the code it generated.

```
https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT ID]&scope=repo&redirect_uri=[WEBHOOK SITE URL]

```

and then run the the following API to get your access token. Store the Access Token in the private repository action secret called MYSHELF. Your workflows will need this.

```
curl -X POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token \
-d "client_id=[CLIENT_ID]" \
-d "client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]" \
-d "code=[CODE FROM WEBHOOK.SITE]" \
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

You should get a response back that contains your access token that you will use.

Permission Scopes to setup for GitHub App. Not all are needed immediately but future dev may require them. Since it is a private repository and you own the GitHub App - the only risk is you.
