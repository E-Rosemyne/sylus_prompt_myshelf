1. **Read the Docs**:
   - Yep - you made it here. I recommend reading through it completely first before starting, then refer back to it as needed.
2. **Sourcecode**:
   - The manual will refer to certain files, you can find them all [here](../files).
   - The manual will refer to certain folders, you can find them all [here](../folders).
3. **Once setups are completed**:
   - Stage `data.json` in your private repo
   - From within your private Custom GPT, retrieve and update `data.json` as needed:
     ```
     retrieve data.json from remote root path=data.json
     ```
     ```
     add "quantum computer" to groceries list. publish to remote. path=updates/data.json
     ```
   - Add reminders, add new 'boxes' for organization. Experiment... and do read the docs :-)
