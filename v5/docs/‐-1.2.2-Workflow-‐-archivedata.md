Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the **`archivedata` workflow** from a DevOps perspective, explaining its purpose, triggers, and step-by-step execution.

---

### **Workflow Name: `archivedata`**
This workflow is designed to **archive the `data.json` file**, clean up old files, and maintain a well-organized repository. It‚Äôs a housekeeping workflow that ensures your repository stays clean and efficient while providing error notifications when things go wrong.

---

### **Trigger Points**
1. **Triggered After `syncdata` Completes**:
   - Automatically runs whenever the `syncdata` workflow finishes.
   - Listens for the `completed` event type.

2. **Manual Trigger**:
   - Can be run manually using the **workflow_dispatch** option in GitHub Actions.

---

### **Job: `archive_and_cleanup`**
This job performs a sequence of operations to archive and clean up files. It runs on the `ubuntu-latest` environment for consistency and reliability.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Checkout the Repository**
- **Purpose**: Fetch the full repository history for proper file handling.
- **Key Details**:
  - Uses `actions/checkout@v3` with `fetch-depth: 0` to ensure access to all historical commits.
  - Authenticated using the `MYSHELF` secret token.

---

#### **Step 2: Set Up Git Configuration**
- **Purpose**: Prepares Git for pushing changes.
- **Key Configurations**:
  - Sets the bot identity as `Ziggy[bot]` with a defined email.
  - Configures the repository URL with the authentication token.

---

#### **Step 3: Archive the Updated `data.json`**
- **Purpose**: Copy the updated `data.json` to the `archive` folder with a timestamped filename.
- **Process**:
  - Creates an `archive` directory if it doesn‚Äôt exist.
  - Names the archived file with the current UTC timestamp (e.g., `archive/data.json.2024-12-26T10.00.00`).
  - Logs the success or failure to `archivedata-error-log.txt`.

---

#### **Step 4: Clean Up Old Backups**
- **Purpose**: Remove archived files older than 30 days to save space and maintain a clean archive.
- **Process**:
  - Identifies files in the `archive` directory older than 30 days.
  - Deletes them and logs the number of removed files.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - Logs an error if cleanup fails and exits the workflow.

---

#### **Step 5: Clean Up the Context Path**
- **Purpose**: Remove files in the `context` folder that are older than 30 days.
- **Process**:
  - Checks if the `context` folder exists.
  - Deletes files older than 30 days.
  - Logs the number of removed files or skips the step if the folder doesn‚Äôt exist.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - Logs an error if cleanup fails and exits the workflow.

---

#### **Step 6: Commit and Push Changes**
- **Purpose**: Save and push all updates, including archived files and cleaned-up folders.
- **Process**:
  - Adds the `archive/` and `context/` directories to Git.
  - Commits the changes with a descriptive message.
  - Pushes updates to the `main` branch.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - Logs errors if any Git operations fail, such as adding files, committing changes, or pushing updates.

---

#### **Step 7: Notify via GitHub Issues**
- **Purpose**: Raise an alert if any step in the workflow fails.
- **Process**:
  - Uses the `peter-evans/create-issue-from-file@v5` action to create an issue.
  - Includes the error log (`archivedata-error-log.txt`) in the issue description.
  - Labels the issue as a bug for easy tracking.

---

### **Key Benefits**
1. **Automated Archiving**:
   - Ensures historical versions of `data.json` are preserved with clear timestamps.
   - Facilitates auditing and rollback if needed.

2. **Efficient Cleanup**:
   - Automatically removes outdated files, preventing clutter and saving storage space.
   - Maintains the repository‚Äôs performance and cleanliness.

3. **Error Transparency**:
   - Provides detailed logs for troubleshooting.
   - Automatically alerts maintainers of issues through GitHub Issues.

---

### **Usage**
- Automatically triggered by `syncdata` or run manually.
- Archives `data.json`, cleans up old files, and pushes changes to the `main` branch.
- Monitors for errors and ensures maintainers are informed when something goes wrong.
