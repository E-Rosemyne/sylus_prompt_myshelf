Creating a custom GPT involves defining a virtual assistant’s behavior, personality, and operational framework through a thoughtfully designed prompt and supporting configuration files. This process allows you to craft a highly personalized and functional AI assistant tailored to your unique needs. It does require you to have access to a ChatGPT+ account.

#### **Configuration Essentials**

1. **Foundation of the Prompt**:

   * The provided prompt defines your assistant’s purpose, operational parameters, and interaction style.  
   * It serves as the core of your assistant’s personality, providing clear guidance on how it should respond and perform tasks.  

2. **Supporting Files**:

In addition to the ziggyprompt.md you will also attach the following files:

From the files folder:

core.json
template.json
schema.json
personamodetemplate.txt
defaultmode.md

From the modules folder:

diagnostics.json
dewey_decimal.json
personamode.json
persona.json 

3. **Custom Naming**:

   * You can rename your virtual assistant to reflect its purpose or personality. The chosen name will align with the Custom GPT and appear consistently throughout interactions.


#### **Capabilities of the Custom GPT**

When configuring your assistant, enable the following capabilities at minimum for maximum functionality:

* **Web Search**: Access real-time data from the web to enhance responses and provide up-to-date information.  
* **DALL-E Image Generation**: Generate images based on descriptive prompts for a more creative and visual experience.  
* **Code Interpreter & Data Analysis**: Handle coding tasks, analyze datasets, and provide computational support.

#### **Integrating with GitHub**

To streamline operations, we use the **private GitHub repository** (e.g., `"MyShelf"`) that we created earlier to manage workflows and files securely. Make sure you have already created your private github repository. Use the provided schema or build your own custom API integration:

* Update `{owner}` in the schema with your GitHub username.  
* The repository must remain private to protect sensitive data.

**Key Features**:

* Manage files like `data.json` for dynamic updates.  
* Automate workflows using GitHub Actions to enhance efficiency.  
* Ensure secure and controlled access to your assistant’s operational framework.

By combining the structured prompt with supporting configuration files, you can create a unique and highly functional Custom GPT. With secure integrations, robust capabilities, and a tailored persona, your virtual assistant becomes a powerful tool to support your tasks and interactions.

### 

#### **GitHub Repository Contents API: `schema`**

This API schema provides an interface to manage files and workflows within a GitHub repository. It supports operations such as retrieving, updating, uploading, deleting files, and triggering GitHub Actions workflows. Designed with flexibility in mind, it uses OpenAPI 3.1.0 standards and integrates seamlessly with repositories for automated or manual file and workflow management.

Note: If you need assistance with assembly of the schema, I found the ActionsGPT from OpenAI very useful

I have included the schema that I am using (CustomGPTgithubschema.txt) all you need to do is change the {owner} to your GitHub profile or Org. You will need to assign an API Key using the Access Token or PAT that you obtained from your GitHub App setup or Personal Access Token creation. I have also included a worldtimeapi schema (CustomGPTworldapischema.txt) but no changes are required of it nor authentication setup.
