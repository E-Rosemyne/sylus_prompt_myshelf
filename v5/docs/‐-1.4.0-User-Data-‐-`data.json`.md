The `data.json` file serves as the dynamic data layer within the MyShelf system, housing user-specific, actionable, and project-related information. Unlike the immutable rules and settings in `core.json`, `data.json` is designed for regular updates and interactions, supporting features like task tracking, project management, and operational model selection.

The primary objective of `data.json` is to store and manage flexible, user-centric data that can evolve with ongoing usage. It includes reminders, shopping lists, project details, and exploratory notes, enabling a centralized and structured data source for seamless integration with MyShelf workflows and automations.
