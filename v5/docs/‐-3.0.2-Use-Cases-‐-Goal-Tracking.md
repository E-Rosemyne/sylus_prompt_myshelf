Goal Tracking:

* Add a 'box' to define and monitor personal or professional goals.
* Create SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals.
* Break goals into smaller tasks with deadlines.
* Visualize progress with charts or timelines.

Example: "Fitness Goal: Run 100 miles in 30 days. Completed: 40 miles."

**Simplified JSON Structure for Goal Tracking**

```json
{
  "GoalTracker": {
    "Goals": [
      {
        "Title": "Run 100 miles in 30 days",
        "StartDate": "2024-12-01",
        "EndDate": "2024-12-30",
        "Target": 100,
        "Progress": 40,
        "Tasks": [
          {
            "Task": "Run 5 miles",
            "Deadline": "2024-12-02",
            "Completed": true
          },
          {
            "Task": "Run 5 miles",
            "Deadline": "2024-12-04",
            "Completed": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why This Approach Works**

1. **Simplified Structure**:
   - Fewer fields to understand, with clearly defined purposes.
   - Core focus on goals and tasks, leaving advanced features (e.g., categories or descriptions) as optional.

2. **Natural Language Support**:
   - Easy prompts to assemble, update, and report on goals.
   - Users can interact without needing to know the underlying structure.

3. **Flexibility for Growth**:
   - Allows for optional fields like categories or progress breakdowns if needed later, but keeps the base structure clean.

**Natural Language Prompts**

**1. Initial Assembly (Creating a Goal)**

- **Example Prompt**:  
  "Hey Ziggy, help me set up a new goal to 'Run 50 miles in 2 weeks' starting on January 1, 2025. Break it into 5-mile tasks every two days."

#### **Your Response**:  
"Sure! Here’s your new goal:  
```json
{
  'Title': 'Run 50 miles in 2 weeks',
  'StartDate': '2025-01-01',
  'EndDate': '2025-01-14',
  'Target': 50,
  'Progress': 0,
  'Tasks': [
    { 'Task': 'Run 5 miles', 'Deadline': '2025-01-03', 'Completed': false },
    { 'Task': 'Run 5 miles', 'Deadline': '2025-01-05', 'Completed': false },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Let me know if you’d like any changes!"

**2. Maintenance (Updating Progress or Tasks)**

- **Example Prompt**:  
  "Hey Ziggy, I ran 5 miles today for my 'Run 50 miles in 2 weeks' goal. Update my progress."

#### **Your Response**:  
"Got it! You’ve now completed 5 out of 50 miles. I’ve updated your progress and marked today’s task as completed."

---

#### **3. Reporting (Visualizing Progress)**

- **Example Prompt**:  
  "Hey Ziggy, show me my progress for 'Run 50 miles in 2 weeks.'"

#### **Your Response**:  
"I’ve generated a quick progress report:  
- Target: 50 miles  
- Completed: 5 miles  
- Remaining: 45 miles  

Would you like me to create a chart or timeline for this?"

---

**4. Flexible Natural Language Inputs**

- Users can interact casually:
  - "Add a new goal to read 2 books in January."
  - "Mark the second task for my fitness goal as done."
  - "Show me all goals ending in December."

This adaptability ensures anyone can use the system regardless of technical skills.

**Built-in User-Friendly Features**

1. **Defaults for Missing Data**:
   - If users forget dates or specifics, offer sensible defaults:
     - "Hey Ziggy, add a fitness goal."  
       *Assume a generic goal with a 1-month duration and daily tasks.*

2. **Pre-filled Suggestions**:
   - Offer templates or examples for common goals:
     - "Would you like to start with a goal like 'Run X miles' or 'Read X books'?"

3. **Automatic Summaries**:
   - Generate clear summaries to confirm actions:
     - "Here’s what I’ve added: A goal to 'Run 50 miles,' starting January 1, 2025, with tasks every two days."

4. **Contextual Guidance**:
   - When users get stuck, provide helpful tips:
     - "You can ask me to update your progress or list all incomplete tasks."

**Visualization Ideas for Reporting**

- **Progress Bars**:  
  - "You’re 40% of the way to completing your goal!"
- **Task Timelines**:  
  - "Here’s a timeline of your remaining tasks."
- **Charts**:  
  - "Here’s a pie chart showing completed vs. remaining tasks."

This streamlined approach ensures the system is friendly, intuitive, and scalable while accommodating users with little to no technical expertise.
