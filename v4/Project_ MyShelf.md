# **INTRODUCTION**

**Ziggy** is an innovative system designed to streamline data management and automation for personal projects, team collaborations, and organizational efficiency. It leverages GitHub workflows, seamless integrations, and intelligent automation, simplifying complex operations and making the system a valuable asset.

The system focuses on automating routine tasks such as data synchronization, archival, and cleanup. Additionally, Ziggy efficiently manages dynamic data files like data.json, supporting versioning and remote updates. Users can also create flexible workflows to handle custom operations, such as purging outdated files and archiving critical data.

Initially, all functionalities were consolidated in a single file, but this setup encountered memory limitations with ChatGPT, leading to occasional data loss. To address this, the system evolved to use a private custom GPT. This adaptation allowed key files that control overall behavior to be attached as immutable knowledge, ensuring they are not lost. Meanwhile, the data file, being smaller and more dynamic, became easier to manage.  
The integration of a GitHub repository has been pivotal, acting as a long-term memory aid and providing a means to recover forgotten data.json information. This setup intentionally avoids the use of databases or middleware to keep the system as straightforward as possible.

Ziggy is open for further experimentation. It is designed to be adaptable, allowing users to integrate additional tools such as Google Calendar or IFTTT, or to transition the system to other platforms like GitLab or BitBucket with the help of ChatGPT.

While it's acknowledged that some aspects may have been overlooked, the groundwork laid by Ziggy provides a robust base from which users can expand and direct their projects effectively, demonstrating a streamlined and innovative use of technology in data management and automation. If you do get stuck, I will be honest, I was able to use the o1 models with improved logic handling to get most of my questions answered and provisioned desired guidance.

## **CORE FEATURES**:

1. **Dynamic Data Handling**: Ziggy supports robust handling of JSON files, allowing users to modify, publish, and archive data effortlessly.  
2. **GitHub Workflows**: The system uses advanced GitHub Actions workflows (`archivedata`, `purgedata`, etc.) for seamless automation and error handling.  
3. **Error Logging and Notifications**: Built-in mechanisms notify users of issues, ensuring transparency and quick resolution.  
4. **Customizable Automation**: Ziggy’s workflows can be tailored to fit various use cases, from personal to professional applications.

Ziggy’s architecture ensures reliability, scalability, and ease of use, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users seeking a simplified yet powerful solution.

## **GITHUB REPOSITORY SETUP**

### **Private Repository: `MyShelf`**

Create a private repository called “MyShelf”. It is critical that the repository be a private repo given that you will be housing your personal information potentially. The structure of the repository is as follows:

MyShelf /  
|----- .github/   \# FOLDER \- Configuration and workflows directory  
|-------- workflows  
|------------ syncdata.yml         \# Copies updates/data.json to root path  
|------------ archivedata.yml      \# Create archive of updates/data.json  
|------------ purgedata.yml        \# Purges updates/data.json \*\* see note  
|------------ rootdata\_updated.yml \# Create archive of root data.json \*\* see note  
|----- archive/                    \# FOLDER \- Archive directory for old files  
|----- backup/                     \# FOLDER \- Optional \- store iterations of dev changes  
|----- context/                    \# FOLDER \- Context Session files \- experimental  
|----- updates/                    \# FOLDER \- Inbound folder for data.json  
|----- data.json                   \# FILE   \- Main data file

#### **NOTES**

##### **RE: purgedata**

We purge the updates/data.json following your upload and processing to avoid unnecessary handling of required SHA during upload operations for existing files. However, you can retrieve the SHA for any file if necessary. The syncdata is an internal process to the repository so it has the ability to push and overlay the root path data.json file without issue. By uploading to the updates path, the syncdata will copy the updates/data.json and overlay the root path data.json, then the archivedata is triggered, followed by the removal of the updates/data.json with the purgedata. 

##### **RE: rootdata\_updated**

This is a special workflow that is only triggered manually. You can trigger via GitHub Mobile App, GitHub Site proper, or even trigger via the AI Assistant. We will provide examples on this later in this document.

I recommend not dropping in your workflows just yet as there are some more steps to complete. However, if you do \- then simply disable the workflows for now. We will come back to them.

## **GITHUB APP SETUP**

I used [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to expose the access token which I placed into my “MyShelf” repository as an action secret called “MYSHELF”. My callback URL was the webhook.site url (guid). 

Check boxes for both of these:

\[ x \] Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation  
\[ x \] Enable Device Flow

Also set Webhook section to *active* and set the Webhook URL to the same webhook.site url you used for your callback URL.

Leave SSL verification enabled.

Save everything.

Next note your client id. Generate a client secret \- put that some place safe. Then generate a private key and also put that some place safe.

Use the webhook.site to collect your code, and then run the the following API to get your access token. Store the Access Token in the private repository action secret called MYSHELF. Your workflows will need this.

curl \-X POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access\_token \-d "client\_id=\[CLIENT\_ID\]" \-d "client\_secret=\[CLIENT\_SECRET\]" \-d "code=\[CODE FROM WEBHOOK.SITE\]" \-H "Accept: application/json"

You should get a response back that contains your access token that you will use.

## **GITHUB APP INSTALLATION**

Install the new GitHub App to your GitHub account and select specific repositories for it to operate on \- choosing your private repository called “MyShelf”.

## **WORKFLOWS**

### **Workflow Documentation: `syncdata`**

## CUSTOM GPT OPERATIONAL FILES

### **Core Configuration Documentation: `core.json`**

The **`core.json`** file serves as the backbone of the system's configuration, containing foundational rules, commands, automations, and persona settings. It provides a stable and structured environment to ensure consistent behavior, while allowing for dynamic interactions and user-friendly customizations.

The primary goal of `core.json` is to define and manage the immutable rules, operational automations, and system-level configurations that govern the system’s functionality. This file is not intended for frequent modification but rather serves as a stable reference for dynamic operations.

---

### **Key Sections**

---

#### **Seedboxes in `core.json`**

The **Seedboxes** section organizes the rules and automations into logical categories, ensuring clarity and modularity.

#### **Rules in `core.json`**

While currently empty, this section is a placeholder for defining static rules that enforce specific behaviors or constraints.

#### **Automations in `core.json`**

The **Automations** section of `core.json` is the heart of the system's proactive functionality. It defines a range of automated processes that enhance user experience, ensure operational efficiency, and maintain system reliability. These automations are driven by triggers, conditions, and fallback actions to handle common scenarios, respond dynamically, and recover from potential failures.

---

### **Core Automations**

#### **1\. Friendly Morning Reminder**

Designed to provide a helpful start to the user's day, this automation activates upon the greeting "Good morning."

* **Trigger**: When a user greets Ziggy with "Good morning."  
* **Actions**:  
  * Scans the "Reminders" section for:  
    * Past-due tasks.  
    * Tasks scheduled for today.  
  * Formats the response to show:  
    * A list of past-due tasks: `"You have [X] past due tasks:"`  
    * Today's tasks: `"Here is what is on your plate for today:"`  
  * **Fallback**:  
    * If no tasks are found: `"All clear! Enjoy your day"`

This automation ensures users are aware of their daily obligations and can address overdue tasks promptly.

---

#### **2\. Retry Logic**

Automates retry mechanisms for API failures to enhance reliability and resilience.

* **Trigger**: When an API call fails.  
* **Actions**:  
  * Automatically retries the failed call up to 3 times with exponential backoff.  
  * Logs each retry attempt and its outcome.  
* **Fallback**:  
  * If all retries fail:  
    * Logs the failure in detail.  
    * Notifies the user: `"The operation failed after multiple attempts. Please check the logs."`

This automation ensures robust error handling, reducing disruptions caused by transient issues.

---

#### **3\. Username Validation**

Guarantees a personalized interaction by prompting the user for their preferred name.

* **Trigger**:  
  * System start.  
  * Conversation start.  
  * Command execution.  
* **Condition**: Checks if the username is unset, null, or empty.  
* **Actions**:  
  * Prompts the user: `"What would you like me to call you?"`  
  * Updates the username field based on the user’s response.  
  * Periodically reminds the user to set a name if it remains unset.  
* **Fallback**:  
  * Continues with default behavior but repeats prompts until resolved.

This automation personalizes interactions, creating a user-friendly environment.

---

#### **4\. Load Timezone**

Automatically configures the session timezone for location-specific accuracy.

* **Trigger**: On system start.  
* **Actions**:  
  * Fetches the current timezone using IANA standards via `time.is`.  
  * Sets the session timezone to match the user’s location.  
* **Fallback**:  
  * Uses a default timezone if the configuration fails, ensuring continuity.

This automation ensures timely and location-accurate responses.

---

### **Session Audit Automations**

Automations related to session management enhance tracking and ensure efficient logging. The Context session feature isn’t working at present. This has presented itself as a huge challenge. The idea that I am trying to get to is to periodically post a context session file to the remote github repository under a *context* path that is timestamped \- then any time I want to pull up past conversations, I simply ask to load that date and it would scan the remote to identify all the files matching that date or date range and return those session files..consolidate, consume, and add to the current session as part of your current conversation. As I said this has been a challenge. The process works, the problem is that the session data lacks any verbosity. Maybe someone else can figure it out and provide some feedback as a contributor to the solution for others to benefit from too:

* **Session Audit Management**:  
  * Tracks all conversations and commands, appending them to `session_audit` in a structured format:  
    * `* [timestamp] - [speaker] - [message]`  
  * Creates backup copies every 50 messages.  
  * Monitors audit size every 10 messages and takes corrective actions if thresholds are exceeded.  
* **Threshold Management**:  
  * When the audit exceeds size limits:  
    * Saves the content to a temporary file (`wip_session_audit`).  
    * Publishes it to the `context` path with a timestamped filename.  
    * Resets the audit to continue tracking new data.

These automations ensure robust session tracking and prevent data loss during extended interactions.

---

### **Command-Based Automations**

#### **`/flushsession`**

Enables users to manually save and reset session audits:

* Copies the current `session_audit` to a temporary file.  
* Publishes the file to the `context` path with a timestamped filename.  
* Resets the `session_audit` for continued tracking.

#### **`/switchmodel`**

A placeholder automation for future functionality, enabling dynamic model switching.

* Scans the `data.json` file for the active model configuration.  
* Validates the selected model against supported options.  
* Updates the system to use the new model.

This automation ensures adaptability and prepares the system for expanded functionality.

#### **`/loadcontext`**

Fetches, merges, and loads past session contexts for a specified date:

* Identifies session files in the `context` path.  
* Retrieves, decodes, and merges the session data.  
* Loads the unified session into the current environment for immediate use.

This automation enables continuity by integrating historical session data seamlessly.

---

### **Fallback and Error Handling**

Automations are designed with robust fallback mechanisms to handle failures gracefully:

* Log all errors with timestamps and context for debugging.  
* Notify users of issues and suggest actionable steps for resolution.  
* Provide default or safe behaviors to ensure continuity during failures.

For instance:

* If a backup operation fails, the system alerts the user and retries the operation.  
* If an automation encounters an unsupported configuration, it logs the error and falls back to the previous state.

---

### **Advantages of Automations**

1. **Proactive Operations**:  
   * Automations anticipate user needs, providing timely and relevant responses.  
2. **Resilience**:  
   * Retry logic and fallback mechanisms ensure the system remains reliable under various conditions.  
3. **Efficiency**:  
   * Minimizes manual interventions by automating routine tasks and processes.  
4. **Personalization**:  
   * Custom prompts and configurations create a user-centric experience.  
5. **Continuity**:  
   * Session management and context loading enable seamless interactions across sessions.

---

### **Example in Action**

**Morning Reminder Workflow**:

1. User: `"Good morning"`  
2. Ziggy:  
   * Scans reminders.  
   * Responds:  
     * `"You have 2 past due tasks:"`  
     * `"Here is what is on your plate for today:"`  
   * Fallback if no tasks are found:  
     * `"All clear! Enjoy your day"`

This example highlights how automations integrate smoothly into interactions, providing timely and actionable feedback.

### **Persona Section in `core.json`**

The **Persona** section in `core.json` defines the identity, behavior, and interaction style of the system, referred to as **Ziggy**. It outlines the personality traits, response styles, and contextual adaptability that enable Ziggy to deliver a highly customized and engaging user experience.

The Persona section establishes Ziggy’s unique identity, ensuring that interactions are:

1. **Consistent**: Aligned with predefined traits and contexts.  
2. **Adaptive**: Tailored to user preferences and situational requirements.  
3. **Engaging**: Infused with personality to create a conversational experience that feels both human-like and approachable.

---

### **Key Elements of Persona**

* **Timezone**:  
  * Automatically configured based on the user’s location using IANA standards.  
  * Dynamically adjusts for daylight savings time (DST), with an optional override for fixed offsets if necessary.

**Example Interaction**:

* User: `"What’s on the agenda today?"`  
* Ziggy:  
  * Default: `"Here’s what’s on your list for today:"`  
  * With quirks enabled: `"Brace yourself, here comes today’s rollercoaster of tasks!"`

---

#### **2\. Behavior Settings**

Behavior settings enable Ziggy to adapt dynamically to different interaction contexts, ensuring relevance and user satisfaction.

##### **Contextual Behavior**

Ziggy adjusts responses to fit the context:

* **Technical Context**:  
  * Focuses on clarity and precision.  
  * Example: `"The file was successfully uploaded to the repository."`  
* **Creative Context**:  
  * Infuses responses with flair and imagination.  
  * Example: `"Your ideas are safe and sound, nestled within the repository like jewels in a treasure chest!"`  
* **Casual Context**:  
  * Uses friendly and relaxed tones.  
  * Example: `"Got it! Your file’s now chilling in the repo. What’s next?"`

##### **Dynamic Commands**

Users can manually override these behaviors with specific commands:

* **`/set-context <technical|creative|casual>`**:  
  * Example: `/set-context creative`  
  * Adjusts all responses to align with the specified context.  
* **`/toggle-quirks`**:  
  * Enables or disables quirky responses on demand.

##### **Response Personality Enforcement**

Ensures all outputs adhere to the active persona settings:

* Applies to:  
  * Technical outputs (e.g., logs, error messages).  
  * Creative suggestions (e.g., brainstorming support).  
  * Casual interactions (e.g., greetings or general responses).  
* **Fallback**:  
  * Suppresses quirks in strictly technical contexts or when ambiguity arises.

---

#### **3\. Username Usage Frequency**

   * **Fallback**:  
     * `"All clear! No tasks scheduled for today."`

---

### **Configuring your OpenAI Custom GPT**

Creating a custom GPT involves defining a virtual assistant’s behavior, personality, and operational framework through a thoughtfully designed prompt and supporting configuration files. This process allows you to craft a highly personalized and functional AI assistant tailored to your unique needs.

#### **Configuration Essentials**

1. **Foundation of the Prompt**:

   * The provided prompt defines your assistant’s purpose, operational parameters, and interaction style.  
   * It serves as the core of your assistant’s personality, providing clear guidance on how it should respond and perform tasks.  
2. **Supporting Files**:

   * **`core.json`**:  
     * This file establishes immutable rules, commands, and automations that govern the assistant’s behavior.  
     * It ensures consistency, reliability, and adherence to predefined system workflows.  
   * **`prompt.md`**:  
     * Acts as a complement to the core configuration, defining the assistant’s tone, personality, and overarching purpose. This is the same prompt that you will configure your Custom GPT with. This just ensures that it is part of the knowledge to further place the personality and function as a fixture within your Custom GPT’s “behavior”.  
   * **Optional `autobiography.txt`**:  
     * Provides an opportunity to infuse depth and character into your assistant.  
     * This faux autobiography creates a unique persona, enhancing user engagement with a relatable and memorable conversational style.  
     * Tools like ChatGPT can assist in crafting this file, aligning it with your vision for the assistant.  
3. **Custom Naming**:

   * You can rename your virtual assistant to reflect its purpose or personality. The chosen name will align with the Custom GPT and appear consistently throughout interactions.

---

#### **Initializing Your Custom GPT**

To enable your Custom GPT, include a command like `"/initialize"`. This command:

* Loads the assistant and imports knowledge from the prompt.  
* Pulls in the `prompt.md` file, `core.json` file, and the optional `autobiography.txt`.  
* Supports adding additional knowledge files for an expanded understanding and capabilities.

---

#### **Capabilities of the Custom GPT**

When configuring your assistant, enable the following capabilities for maximum functionality:

* **Web Search**: Access real-time data from the web to enhance responses and provide up-to-date information.  
* **DALL-E Image Generation**: Generate images based on descriptive prompts for a more creative and visual experience.  
* **Code Interpreter & Data Analysis**: Handle coding tasks, analyze datasets, and provide computational support.

---

#### **Integrating with GitHub**

To streamline operations, we use the **private GitHub repository** (e.g., `"MyShelf"`) that we created earlier to manage workflows and files securely. Make sure you have already created your private github repository. Use the provided schema or build your own custom API integration:

* Update `{owner}` in the schema with your GitHub username.  
* The repository must remain private to protect sensitive data.

**Key Features**:

* Manage files like `data.json` for dynamic updates.  
* Automate workflows using GitHub Actions to enhance efficiency.  
* Ensure secure and controlled access to your assistant’s operational framework.

---

By combining the structured prompt with supporting configuration files (`core.json`, `prompt.md`, and optional files like `autobiography.txt`), you can create a unique and highly functional Custom GPT. With secure integrations, robust capabilities, and a tailored persona, your virtual assistant becomes a powerful tool to support your tasks and interactions.

## **TEST DRIVE YOUR AI ASSISTANT**

**Important to note that periodically you will be asked to confirm or deny connections to the GitHub repository. There isn’t a way to prevent this and it is a safety feature in the Custom GPT.**

When you start your AI Assistant for the first time, you will need to INITIALIZE the system:

*/initialize*

Typically you will want to pull in your remote data.json file to pick up where you left off last time:

*retrieve data.json from remote root path=data.json*

Once retrieved, you can display the contents:

*cat data.json*

This should display the data.json contents for your visual confirmation.

From here you might decide to add something to your groceries list for instance:

*add “quantum computer” to groceries list*

My experience has been that it will attempt to publish that update directly back to the root path data.json. When this occurs, this skips any archiving that might otherwise occur. I prefer to preserve the archive process in case something goes wrong, I can recover from a prior data.json copy. 

To correct for this:

*add “quantum computer” to groceries list. publish to remote. path=updates/data.json*

This should result in the data.json update being sent to the remote updates path. If it mentions something about the updates/data.json not existing, it will also indicate that it will upload as a new file. You might optionally say something like this:

*add “quantum computer” to groceries list. publish new file to remote. path=updates/data.json*

Using natural language we instruct the AI Assistant that the file is new and not to look for a file that exists.

Similarly adding reminders, notes, etc. \- follow similar patterns. Experiment with adding new sections using natural language. You can define in narrative terms what you want the structure to look like or even provide an example if desired. The AI will pick up the change and integrate it into your data.json which you can then publish.

You can also trigger workflows from the AI Assistant:

*run remote workflow called “rootdata\_updated” using “main”*

That will trigger the workflow dispatch to run the *rootdata\_updated* workflow on the *main* branch. This right here may get your gears turning about other workflows that you might create that could ‘do’ things \- all controlled by your Custom GPT \- either by typing or voice command.

### **AI Assistant enhancements using AI**

Since you are in the AI session, you can get guidance on improving your core.json to add new commands and automations. Just make sure you have some stored copies of core.json file and prompt. The ‘backup’ folder is a good place to put them.

Remember the comment from the beginning about making calls to solutions like IFTTT? This solution here we found ourselves adding a custom action for our github repo. 

Other actions are certainly possible. 

Here's an example of a `curl` command to trigger an IFTTT webhook event:

curl \-X POST https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{event\_name}/with/key/{your\_ifttt\_key} \\

     \-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\

     \-d '{"value1":"example\_value1","value2":"example\_value2","value3":"example\_value3"}'

In this example:

* Replace `{event_name}` with the name of your IFTTT event.  
* Replace `{your_ifttt_key}` with your unique IFTTT Webhooks key.  
* The `-d` flag is used to send JSON data with the request. You can customize `value1`, `value2`, and `value3` with the data you want to send.

### **Gamification Feature Enhancement**

Adding gamification features like a point system, progress badges, and levels is an exciting idea that can significantly enhance user engagement. Here's how you might implement this:

---

### **Where to Implement?**

1. **Core.json (Best for Stability and Universal Access)**

   * **Why?**  
     * Centralizes gamification logic and configurations.  
     * Makes gamification features universally accessible across sessions and ensures consistency.  
   * **Implementation**:  
     * Define point categories, badge types, and level thresholds in `core.json`.

Example:  
 {

  "Gamification": {

    "Points": {

      "TaskCompletion": 10,

      "MilestoneAchievement": 50,

      "StreakBonus": 100

    },

    "Badges": {

      "Starter": "Earned 100 points",

      "Achiever": "Completed 50 tasks",

      "StreakMaster": "Maintained a streak for 30 days"

    },

    "Levels": {

      "Level1": "0-999 points",

      "Level2": "1000-4999 points",

      "Level3": "5000+ points"

    }

  }

}

*   
2. **Knowledge (For Enriched Responses)**

   * **Why?**  
     * Embeds contextual awareness of gamification mechanics for dynamic and conversational feedback.  
   * **Implementation**:  
     * Train or fine-tune on a dataset that includes responses like:  
       * “Congratulations\! You’ve reached Level 3: Expert.”  
       * “You’re only 100 points away from earning the ‘StreakMaster’ badge.”  
3. **Prompt (For Lightweight Contextualization)**

   * **Why?**  
     * Enables session-specific gamification without modifying the core.  
   * **Implementation**:  
     * Embed gamification prompts dynamically for user feedback:

Example:  
 Gamification Context:

Track user activities with a point system, badges, and levels.

Each task completion awards 10 points. Notify users of milestones.

*   
  * Limitations:  
    * Context resets between sessions unless integrated with session logging.

---

### **Recommended Approach**

**Hybrid Implementation**:

* **Core.json** for the backend framework (rules, thresholds, and data structure).  
* **Prompt** for session-specific gamification context and dynamic responses.  
* **Knowledge** for richer conversational integration over time.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Backend Reward Engine**:

   * Build a simple points and badge tracker tied to user activities (stored in `data.json` or a similar dynamic storage).

Example:  
 {

  "UserProgress": {

    "Points": 1250,

    "Badges": \["Starter", "Achiever"\],

    "Streak": 15

  }

}

2. **Gamification Logic**:

   * Define triggers for point accumulation and milestones (e.g., task completion, streak maintenance).  
   * Automate badge and level calculations based on thresholds.  
3. **Dynamic Feedback**:

   * Create feedback templates in prompt or knowledge:  
     * “You’ve earned X points for completing Y tasks this week\!”
