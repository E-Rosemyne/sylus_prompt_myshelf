# PRE-REQS

* Must have ChatGPT+. For this type of experimentation, one can assume you do already.
* You will be creating a Custom GPT

# INSTRUCTIONS

* Copy the prompt markdown content and add as the prompt for your custom GPT
* Download the core.json and attach as a file
* Download the data.json and attach as a file
* Set the options at the bottom for web search, dall-e, and the analysis
* Publish as a private Custom GPT, you won't be sharing it with anyone since it will contain your pesonal information

# STARTUP

From here I recommend that you use your phone so you can take advantage of voice and a headset/earbud.

* Start up a fresh session of your Personal Assistant
* It should load up the core.json and the data.json files both.

Things you can ask:

* Ask about ```commands``` to see some key system options.
* Ask about ```how do I add reminders```.
* Ask about ```how do I add new boxes```.
* Ask about ```what options can I change about your Persona```
* Ask about ```what configuration options are available for how you talk to me```
* Ask about ```can I set my name```

and a lot more.

You can even discuss how to expand abiltities

```if I have ideas on new rules or automations, can you help me discuss, identify risks, and even implement them```

Ask about logs

```do you keep an activity log```

Most important part - periodic saving of your data.json - this is your user data.

```how do I save my current data.json```

Keep your saved copy up to date with periodic saves. In the event you run into a scenario where it seems "MyShelf" has fallen off the rails, you can simply go to your Custom GPT, remove the previous data.json file - upload your latest. Publish the Custom GPT. The start up a new instance of the Custom GPT and ```initialize``` - it will load the core.json and data.json again and you are back up and running where you left off. Since we have split the core and data, the data.json is able to change as needed and we do not risk corrupting the core functionality.

Hope you find it interesting.
